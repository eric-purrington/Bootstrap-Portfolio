# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Homework 2
Using bootstrap components put together a website/portfolio.

## index
My about me/index page consists of a navbar, container holding a small grid system, and a footer. I only made a few changes to bootstraps html code including pushing links to the right in the navbar, not using a list since I could just use anchors, I played around with grid a lot in the container.

## contact
In the contact page, the same main parents were used (navbar, container, and footer). I also used the form component from bootstrap to layout the contant ability. 

## portfolio
The portfolio page also had a navbar, container, and footer. This page took awhile to make the pictures to orientate correctly probably due to the built in code of bootstrap components. Pictures used were taken from lorempixel.

## style
The main components styled with css were, you guessed it, the navbar, container, and footer. I played around with the margins and padding a lot. I also changed colors and fonts to match the given pictures as best as I could.
